First of all, let me get something straight: This is a JOURNAL, not a diary. I know what it says on the cover, but when Mom went out to buy this thing I SPECIFICALLY told her to get one that didnâ€™t say 'diary' on it. Great. All I need is for some jerk to catch me carrying this book around and get the wrong idea.
