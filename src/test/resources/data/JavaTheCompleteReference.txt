In Java, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the .java extension. Those source files are then compiled into .class files by the javac compiler. A .class file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). The java command is used to launch the JVM, which loads the .class files, verifies the bytecodes, and interprets them into instructions on the native hardware. This level of abstraction provides several advantages, including making Java programs platform-independent
